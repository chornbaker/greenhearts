# Github Rules

When working with Git in this project, follow these rules strictly:

1. All new work must be done in branches prefixed with:
   - `feature/` for new features (e.g., `feature/add-login-page`).
   - `bug/` for bug fixes (e.g., `bug/fix-login-crash`).
   - `fix/` for minor fixes or refactoring (e.g., `fix/update-deps`).
2. Always create new branches from the `develop` branch, never from `main`.
3. Do not commit or merge directly into `main`. The `main` branch is reserved for production-ready code and must only be updated via pull requests.
4. After completing work on a branch, push it to the remote repository and create a pull request targeting `develop` for review.
5. Merge branches into `develop` only after a pull request is approved. Use `git merge` or rebase as needed, but never bypass the pull request process.
6. Keep branch names descriptive and related to the task (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `bug/navbar-overlap`).
7. If I ask for a Git operation, suggest commands that align with this workflow and explain why they fit the process.
